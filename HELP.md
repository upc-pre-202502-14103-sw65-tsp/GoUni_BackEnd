### Project-Specific Information

This project contains the following specific features:


	1.	Project Purpose:
	•	The goal is to create an application that connects students with university opportunities by providing a management system for users, profiles, and roles.

	2.	Key Components:
	•	Profiles Management: Manage user profiles registered within the system.
	•	Roles and Security: Implement role-based access control, such as ROLE_USER and ROLE_DRIVER, and authentication using JWT.
	•	MySQL Connection: Data persistence using MySQL as the relational database.

### Setup Instructions


1. **Clone the repository** from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StudentConnect/GoUni.git
   cd GoUni

2. **Set up a local MySQL database**:
    - Create a database named `gouni_db`.
    - Ensure the credentials in `application.properties` or `application.yml` match your MySQL setup.


3. **Run Maven to install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
    ```
   
4. **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Swagger UI**: 

Access the API documentation at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).


### Configuration and Environment Variables

For security and flexibility, certain configurations should be set via environment variables:

- **DB_USERNAME**: The MySQL database username.
- **DB_PASSWORD**: The MySQL database password.
- **JWT_SECRET**: The secret key for JWT token generation.
- **SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE**: Set the active profile (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

Ensure these are configured before running the application.

### Maven Parent Overrides

To avoid unnecessary inheritance in the project’s `pom.xml`, you can disable certain inherited configurations if necessary.

For example, if you wish to override certain elements like `<license>` and `<developers>`, you can add empty override blocks in your `pom.xml` as shown below:

```xml
<project>
  <licenses></licenses>
  <developers></developers>
</project>
```
   
## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or runtime, consider the following steps:

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
    - Verify that your MySQL database is running and that the credentials in `application.properties` or `application.yml` are correct.
    - Ensure that the MySQL service is properly configured and accessible from your application.
    - Check for the correct database URL format in your configuration file.


2. **Dependency Errors**:

    - Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed by running:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    - Check the `pom.xml` for any missing or conflicting dependencies.


3. **Application Fails to Start**:

    - Review the Spring Boot logs for error messages to diagnose startup issues.
   
    - Check if the active profile (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) is properly set in your environment variables.
   
    - Confirm that your port (default: 8080) is not already in use by another service.


4. **JWT Authentication Issues**:

    - Ensure that the **JWT_SECRET** environment variable is set and matches the key used during token generation.
    - Verify that JWT tokens are correctly formatted and not expired.


5. **Swagger UI Not Loading**:
    - Ensure that the application is running on the correct port.
    - Access Swagger UI at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).
    - Verify the `springdoc-openapi` dependency is included in the project.


If issues persist, consult the [Spring Boot reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/) or seek help from the project maintainers.
